If you want to use git version of it, see the branch "libkml-git" of this repo.

Welcome to libkml!

This is the source code for the libkml project. The main project page is at:
http://libkml.googlecode.com/

All of our documentation is on the project wiki:
http://code.google.com/p/libkml/w/list

The wiki contains documents that describe:
- An overview of the most recent release
- Building and running the code
- Running the unit tests
- A general API reference guide
- More details guides to each of the libkml modules

The main project page has links to the discussion group and the mailing list
that mirrors the commit and issue logs.

Note on strings in libkml:
As of r680, we changed all use of "std::string" to just "string". This change
was motivated by a desire to permit use in codebases that provide their own
string class. This change was transparent to you because of this change to
src/kml/base/util.h:

#ifndef HAS_GLOBAL_STRING
using std::string;
#endif

All string-using code in libkml was modified to pull in that header.
