This is a wxWidgets-based application that uses the "regionator" library in
libkml. 

This current version builds with Mac OS X only.

It depends upon wxWidgets 2.8.8, available from
http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

The build recipe for wxWidgets was:

  cd wxMac-2.8.8
  mkdir build-static-release
  cd build-static-release
  ../configure --enable-monolithic --disable-shared
  make && make install

A single, static library is built for convenience. See the wxWidgets
documentation if you'd like to build the individual shared libraries. You will
of course need to change the build configuration(s) for this wxregionator app.
You can see some of the necessary config options by running the wx-config
application with the --cppflags and --libs options.

The libkml libraries are assumed to be installed at /usr/local/lib/libkml*.
This project will link them statically to the binary such that the resultant
application may be run on systems that have neither libkml nor wxwidgets
installed.
